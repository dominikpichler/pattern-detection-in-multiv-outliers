# 1. Pattern Detection in multivariate Outliers
While there already exist some suitable (software) solutions to robustly detect
outliers in multivariate datasets, for example, algorithms based on a robust version of the
Mahalanobis distance published by  [Leys et.al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103117302123), the amount and quality of
information that can be algorithmically obtained about the origins and mechanisms behind
such outliers are still limited. Therefore this project tries to create an algorithm that can reliably
discover such hidden mechanisms with the help of modern pattern detection algorithms, to thereby help researchers and scientists to gain deeper insights into the origins and
mechanisms behind the occurrences of outliers in their data sets.
